#### Welcome!
Here is a link to the description of the program on the [JBS website](http://www.brandeis.edu/jbs/upcomingprograms/cosivoice/index.html)

The JBS counts as 3 100-level Computer Science electives. These are neither of type A or B, so undergraduates still need to take at least 2 additional electives for their CS degree.  It also counts as a semester of residence, so students can graduate a semester early.

Here's a video from the very [first JBS](http://www.brandeis.edu/now/2010/july/jbsvideo.html)
